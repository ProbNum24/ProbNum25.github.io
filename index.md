The **International Conference on Probabilistic Numerics** (**ProbNum**) is a gathering of researchers working on algorithms that quantify or utilize **computational uncertainty**, i.e. the error arising when a mathematical task is performed on a discrete computer in finite time. 

Of particular interest are numerical algorithms for use within **machine learning**; **artificial intelligence**; **scientific simulation**, and **computational statistics**, due to these communities' innate interest in **uncertainty quantification**. 

The goal of the conference is an open exchange of ideas, aiming to embrace computational uncertainty to make **computations** **faster**, **more reliable**, and **easier to design and use**. 

### Dates and Venue 

ProbNum25 will be held at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) in [Sophia Antipolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Antipolis) near Nice, France, from **1-3 September 2025**.

### Is ProbNum 2025 for me?

A [probabilistic numerical method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_numerics) is an algorithm that quantifies error arising from the finite nature of computation. In this context, the process of computation is often interpreted in the language of probabilistic (or Bayesian) inference, where computation is treated as a source of information, much like data in statistics and machine learning. Probabilistic numerical methods are thus also called *computation aware*. While such algorithms *may* in some cases use random numbers, *stochasticity* is a concept complementary to probabilistic inference: Probabilistic numerical methods are not necessarily stochastic numerical methods, and many stochastic numerical methods are not computation aware. Instead, probabilistic numerical methods typically return probability *measures*, e.g. parametrized through sufficient statistics or moments. Beyond the basic goal of quantifying computational uncertainty, the value of probabilistic functionality is that it uses the same mathematical concepts and code functionality as statistics and machine learning, which simplifies overarching goals like inference on parameters or latent forces in scientific simulation (aka. inverse problems), joint inference on a physical system from both mechanistic and empirical data (aka. data assimilation), the adaptiv control of algorithmic cost, or more generally the use of numerical methods inside of machine learning systems. In this sense, probabilistic numerical methods provide a native algorithmic formalism for AI, ML, and Statistics.

ProbNum25 aims to be an inclusive, enjoyable venue for the discussion, dissemination and promotion of such ideas. We welcome [submissions](/submissions.html) from researchers in academia and industry, from theory to applications. We also invite interested participants who want to learn more about the field without submitting their own yet to attend. Dedicated **tutorials** will provide introductions and overviews of multiple areas.

### Registration
The event is open to all. We expect to open registrations on **14th May 2025**.

### Proceedings and Call for Papers
As our community grows, we are moving towards a broader conference format: ProbNum25 will have **proceedings**, published as a volume of the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research. More details [here](/submissions.html).
